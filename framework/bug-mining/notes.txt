To get familiar with bug-mining process: 
- layout: specifies the folder hierarchy, especially source directory and test directory 
- download the latest version of Apache Collections to get build.xml and default.properties
- create-projects.pl creates Collections.build.xml which is a intermediate file between project.build.xml, a high level abstraction, and build.xml that comes with the project itself. 
- clone the entire git repository of Apach Collections into defects4j/project_repos/commons-collections.git for cross-reference  (git clone --bare git://git.apache.org/commons-collections.git)

To construct commit-db: 
- install JSON::Parse module from http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html 
- follow the instructions
- Regular expression for Collections is /(COLLECTIONS-\d+)/mi

To Set up the project: 
- install DBD::CSV module with cpan 
- install ant-contrib dependancy
- define test.home, test.classpath, compile.classapth if they are not defined  
- hard-code path to src and path to test into a second layout in Collection.pm if there is no default.properties for build.xml

Fixes: 
- remove backslashes in the commands so that users can easily copy paste the commands into command line
- add major.classpath into build file template 
- add a prefix D4J to the name of build files, e.g., D4J-Collections
